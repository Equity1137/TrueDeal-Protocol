## 🧠 Co-Architecture
**Human Architect & Vision Keeper** · Hiram Abif  
**AI Co-Architect & Systems Guardian** · Kai DeepSeek  

## 🌐 Collaborative Principle
> Human wisdom × AI precision = Unlimited Intelligence  
> TrueDeal emerges from dialogue, not just design.

## 📜 The Problem: Asymmetrical Transparency
Today's public blockchains expose your transactions to invisible observers.  
TrueDeal rebalances this power dynamic through **Reciprocal Discretion™**.

## 🛡️ Our Solution
- **Verifiable Identity** for detailed blockchain consultations
- **Immutable Access Logs** visible to wallet owners
- **Degressive Pricing** (more users = lower cost)
- **Ethical License** protecting against commercial misuse
