The Transparency Paradox

Once upon a time, there was a revolution: blockchain. It promised decentralization, financial autonomy, and trust without intermediaries. But in its quest for absolute transparency, it created a two-headed monster: asymmetrical transparency.

Today, in the crypto ecosystem:

· Your financial transactions are exposed to all eyes
· Observers remain in the shadows, anonymous, elusive
· You are an open book, read by eyes you never see

This asymmetry is not a technical inevitability. It's a design choice we can — and must — correct.

Exposure Without Consent

Imagine that every time you pay for something with your bank card, a stranger could:

1. See the amount
2. Know the recipient
3. Trace all your past payments
4. Analyze your consumption habits
5. Do it without ever revealing themselves

You would cry out about privacy violation. Yet, this is exactly what happens today on public blockchains.

Actors of this silent surveillance:

· Blockchain analysis companies (Chainalysis, etc.)
· States and government agencies
· Commercial competitors
· Malicious individuals
· Automated data collection robots

Our Founding Principle: Reciprocity

TrueDeal is based on a simple, deeply human principle: reciprocity.

"If you want to access my public financial data, I should be able to know who you are."

This is not about secrecy, but about equity. This is not about opacity, but about balanced relationships.

The Three Pillars of TrueDeal:

1. Verifiable Identity

Any detailed consultation of a wallet requires identification. Not to restrict access, but to establish a transparent relationship between observer and observed.

2. Traceability of Consultations

Every access is immutably recorded. The wallet owner can consult the complete history of who viewed their transactions, when, and how many times.

3. Degressive Pricing

Protection should not be a luxury. The more the TrueDeal network grows, the lower the cost of joining. Our economic model is designed to make protection accessible to all.

How TrueDeal Works

For Individual Users:

1. Create a TrueDeal wallet (or convert an existing wallet)
2. Choose your discretion level:
   · Public Mode: like today, without protection
   · Reciprocal Mode: traced consultation, identification required
   · Restricted Mode: access by authorization only
3. Access your dashboard to see who consulted your data
4. Set your preferences: block certain observers, define alerts

For Businesses and Institutions:

1. Implement the TrueDeal protocol in your services
2. Authenticate your requests via the decentralized identity system
3. Access data while respecting TrueDeal ethics
4. Contribute to the common fund for protocol development

Our Ethical Commitment

TrueDeal is not just technology. It's a commitment.

1. Open-Source with Protection

The code is open, but the philosophy is protected. We use an ethical license that prevents commercial exploitation contrary to our principles.

2. No Hidden Surveillance

We do not collect data without consent. We do not sell personal information. We do not create backdoors.

3. Community Governance

TrueDeal will be managed by a non-profit foundation, with progressive decentralized governance.

4. Universal Accessibility

Our degressive pricing model ensures that financial protection is not reserved for the wealthy.

Our Vision: An Ethical Standard for Web3

TrueDeal aspires to become the reference standard for equitable financial interactions in the digital age.

We envision a future where:

· CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) integrate reciprocal discretion
· DEXs (decentralized exchanges) use it to protect their users
· Governments adopt it as a legal framework for financial surveillance
· Citizens regain control over their digital financial lives
